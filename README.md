# Graphed Registry

Content registry for the Graphed CLI: **scaffolds** (starting points) and
**plugins** (add-on marketing capabilities). The CLI does not bundle this
content — it clones the public mirror
([graphed-inc/registry](https://github.com/graphed-inc/registry)) at runtime
and caches it at `~/.config/graphed/registry`, so kit updates ship without a
CLI release. To develop against a local checkout of this repo instead of the
cached copy, use `--registry <path>` / `GRAPHED_REGISTRY`.

## Mental model

The consumer of a plugin is an **agent**, not a package manager. A plugin is
therefore an *integration kit*, not an installable artifact:

- `plugin.yaml` — machine-readable manifest (what it provides, what it needs)
- `AGENT.md` — the integration runbook the agent follows (singular on purpose:
  it is read explicitly when `graphed plugins add` points at it, never
  auto-loaded into future sessions like the `AGENTS.md` convention)
- `README.md` — human-facing overview
- `manifest.yaml` — `graphed.yaml` fragment (jobs/env) the CLI can merge
  mechanically with `graphed plugins add --apply-manifest`
- `files/` — tested reference source the agent adapts into the host project

The CLI stages kits. The agent integrates them. Verification checklists in
`AGENT.md` — not determinism — are the quality bar.

## Layout

```
index.json               # catalog of scaffolds + plugins (validated by zod)
scaffold/
  scaffold.yaml          # { name, version, description }
  files/                 # template tree; __PROJECT_SLUG__ / __PROJECT_NAME__ tokens
plugins/
  <name>/
    plugin.yaml
    AGENT.md
    README.md
    manifest.yaml
    files/
```

## Authoring rules

1. **Validate before commit.** `graphed plugins validate --registry <path>`
   schema-checks `index.json`, every `plugin.yaml`/`scaffold.yaml`, and that
   referenced paths exist.
2. **Plugins target the scaffold's conventions.** Reference code in `files/`
   must integrate cleanly into a project born from the current scaffold — an
   npm-workspace layout where domain logic lives in `packages/core`
   (numbered TypeScript Kysely migrations in `packages/core/src/migrations/`,
   table types registered once in `packages/core/src/db/types.ts`, env via
   zod `envSlice()`), job entrypoints in `packages/jobs/src/`, and dashboard
   pages in `packages/dashboard/app/` (nav registry:
   `packages/dashboard/lib/plugins.ts`). Dashboard UI is shadcn/ui — plugin
   pages compose `components/ui/*` and add missing ones via the shadcn CLI.
   Declare `compat.scaffold` as a minimum version.
3. **No dry-run gates.** Plugins work end-to-end out of the box — clients
   should never have to learn a "safe mode" flag. Safety comes from the
   default configuration instead: a plugin's default config must not write
   to external platforms (e.g. the seo kit's `cms.type: "none"` generates
   drafts only), and the AGENT.md verification steps exercise that default
   before any real credential is added.
4. **Secrets are declared, never hardcoded.** Every secret the kit needs goes
   in `plugin.yaml` `secrets:` with a description; the CLI surfaces them to
   the operator after `add`.
5. **AGENT.md is a runbook, not an essay.** Ordered steps, the decisions the
   agent must ask the user (e.g. which CMS), exact file destinations, and a
   closing verification checklist (local compose Postgres first, then deploy).
6. **Keep `files/` minimal and real.** Distill from production systems; cut
   entanglement with other channels. Zero-dependency (`fetch`, platform env)
   is strongly preferred over new npm packages.

## Versioning

- Every scaffold and plugin carries a semver `version`.
- A generated project is stamped with the scaffold version in its
  `graphed.yaml` (`scaffold:` block — stripped by the CLI on deploy, never
  sent to the server).
- `plugins add` warns when a kit's `compat.scaffold` range doesn't cover the
  project's stamped scaffold version (`--force` overrides).

## Publishing

Content here ships via a manual mirror release run by the maintainers;
consumers always read the published snapshot.
